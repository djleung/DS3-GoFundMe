Follow Rhys’s story and current updates at www.RiseUpForRhys.org\\xa0and on Instagram @RiseUpForRhysIn May of 2019 while on vacation in Scotland, Rory and I found out we were pregnant (though I already knew - mother’s intuition kicks in early!)\\xa0 Our baby girl was due on Christmas Day, and after a perfectly healthy pregnancy and 20 hours of labor, we welcomed her 3 weeks early on December 4, 2019 at 12:13pm. Even though I had sworn not to give my children confusing-to-pronounce Welsh names as my mother had done to me, we decided to name her Rhys (pronounced Reese). Overnight she made us a family, and even her fur brother Bruce was absolutely in love. (Jury is still out for Tony).Rhys had been a healthy baby, loving her baths, walks outside, and cuddles and kisses from her doggies. As Rhys approached 4 months, that mother’s intuition was nagging me - I noticed that she seemed to be falling behind on milestones other babies her age were hitting. She always struggled with tummy time, and wasn’t able to roll over or hold her head up for very long. At her 4 month check up, our pediatrician said she just had low muscle tone and recommended physical therapy. At her next check up at 6 months, the pediatrician immediately noted Rhys’ lack of progression and expressed concerns that she may have Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic condition we had never heard of before.\\xa0A quick Google search, confirmed every parent’s greatest fear: \"The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old.\" Appointments with Geneticists and Pediatric Neuro-muscular Specialists were set, blood and saliva tests ordered, and the waiting began. We hoped it was something else less severe, easier to treat, less devastating. ANYTHING but SMA. After 2 weeks, the longest 2 weeks of our lives, we received the heartbreaking diagnosis - Rhys has SMA Type 1, the most severe form of the disease.SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease, affecting eating, speaking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure \\u200bbefore reaching the age of two. With SMA Type 1, each day means loss of specialized nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and muscle cell death. It is so rare that just a few years ago, there was no treatment. Parents had to watch as their child was able to move less and less, becoming unable to eat and breath on their own.There is no cure for SMA, but in the last 2 years, two life changing treatments have become available. One treatment, SPINRAZA, works on the SMN2 gene, which is a less active copy of the SMN1 gene (the gene that is missing/non-functioning in a person with SMA). By boosting production of SMN2, SPINRAZA supports muscle development and provides a level of improvement. SPINRAZA is very expensive at $750K in the first year and $375K every year thereafter for life. In August of 2019, a new gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA was approved by the FDA. It replaces the missing/non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy. This medicine provides life changing improvement, some patients are even able to walk independently. Such a miracle drug comes at a cost, and ZOLGENSMA is the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million USD. Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, this is a race against time. With each day that passes, motor neurons in Rhys’ sweet little body are becoming inactive. All funds raised will go to Rhys’s medical care including gene therapy (out-of-pocket responsibility outside of insurance not known at this time), physical and occupational therapy, mobility and development equipment, etc. She has a lifetime ahead of her and will need continuous treatment for the best chance at a full life. In the case there are additional funds beyond Rhys’s needs, they will go to Cure SMA, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for this devastating disease.\\xa0Every child should have the best possible chance at life - please join us to surround our happy little girl in love and support.

I still remember that day. We were very happy as i hold her in my arms. She was a healthy baby girl and i still remember her bright and big eyes staring me. We immediately fell in love with her and start thinking of her future. We thought of providing her every needs of her life- a good education and most important a better human. Everyday with her went on so fast when we realized she already turned 4 months. I then began to realize she was not able to hold her head nor turn sideways. She was breastfeeding normally and was gaining her usual weight. Some of our family members told this is normal and she will be be holding her head in few months. We believed and carried on dreaming of her bright future.\\n\\nDays passed on and she was now 5 months. Still she was not holding her head. Now we were worried,so visited our doctor. Our doctor examined and did some neurological exam, few blood tests and a brain scan. Everything was normal and we were told she might be having a benign hypotonia of infancy. Just a bit physiotherapy and nothing much to worry about: I still remember my doctor words. We were happy she was alright and began her physiotherapy. Now she was 6 months, still hypotonic. We knew something was not right and again visited our doctor. Now our doctor advised us to visit a senior neurologist and we did so. I still remember that day, the saddest day of our life, the day when our dreams were shattered. The neurologist after assessing our child and looking the prior reports immediately told us she might be a having a neuromuscular disease only to be confirmed by genetic disease and most probably our child might be having the severe form of the disease. That was the day when we first heard of this disease called SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY. Blood was drawn and sent for genetic testing and we returned with heavy hearts.\\n\\nI was very tensed and started looking after it in internet. I was told about it a bit by my neurologist. It is a progressive neuromuscular disease that gradual weakens the muscles of limbs,swallowing and breathing. You can imagine the outcome. My child can’t sit up nor walk stand, she will not be able to eat and drink and finally not able to breathe on her own. Without timely treatment most of infants with severe form of SMA will be on permanent ventilation within a year of life and rarely survive beyond two years. I was always praying to god that our reports will be negative but i was wrong. Finally got the reports that showed my daughter Siyona had type 1 SMA. My neurologist told me the prognosis and gene therapy was the only cure. Gene therapy drug called Zolgensma costs nearly 2.1 million usd and we are no longer in a position to afford. We need your support to afford my daughter\\'s treatment. I wish to see her stand and run and fulfill her dream. Please donate for my daughter and fulfill her desire to live and achieve her dream. We believe Siyona is one of the luckiest to receive Zolgensma.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE-Utilization of fund.What if?\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 Lastly what is the plan if target is not met? How will the raised funds be utilised?\\n\\nFirst of all, seeing the support of all wellwishers all around the globe, I don’t see anything why our target won’t be met. Siyona deserves life and there are so many prayers and efforts that can’t be unheard by the God.\\xa0 We will achieve the target.\\xa0 I am her father and I have seen her suffering everyday and if any mishap happens or funds couldn’t be raised, then the funds will be utilised only for the palliative care of Siyona. I am a Nepal based doctor and I have seen how difficult is there for a Nepali patient to fight SMA. The remaining funds will be utilised to raise a SMA foundation in Nepal that will work entirely for the upliftment of SMA patients in Nepal including their palliative care. We are already on this process and the legal formalities are delayed by covid. We will soon update the process.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions:\\nHow you are related to your beneficiary?\\n\\n\\nHello again, I am Anish Kumar Shrestha and Siyona is my niece.Her father Dr Sandeep Shrestha is my father\\'s sister\\'s son.While donations are being done by the generous donors, I have to regularly withdraw the amount.

Bebeğimiz doğduğunda her şey çok normaldi, ta ki 4.ayına kadar… Hareketlerinin giderek yavaşladığını fark edip hastaneye gittiğimizde acı gerçekle yüzleştik. Oğlumuza, canımıza SMA TİP1 adı verilen genetik ve ölümcül bir kas hastalığı teşhisi konuldu. Bu hastalık kasları besleyerekhareket etmemizi sağlayan genin olmamasından kaynaklanıyor. Hastalık tedavi edilmediği takdirde ilerleyici ve ölümcül sonuçlar doğuruyor. SMN1 geninin bir mutasyon sebebi ile yok olması ve motor nöron sinir hücrelerinin bu genin ürettiği proteini alamaması sonucunda ortaya çıkan bu hastalık,tüm dünyada bebek ölümlerine yol açan genetik geçişli hastalıklar arasında ilk sırada gelmektedir. Yürüme, nefes alma, yutkunma, konuşma gibi hayati önem taşıyan sistemleri yok etmektedir. Bu hastalığın 4 tipi vardır ve en ağır türü olan 1.TİP hastalar bebeklik çağında (çoğunlukla 2 yaşından önce) gelişemeyen akciğer kapasiteleri nedeni ile yaşamlarını kaybediyorlar. Bu hastalığın tek çaresi ise Amerika’da tek doz uygulama ile tedavi edici özellikli Zolgensma adlı gen tedavisidir. Bu gen tedavisi SMA hastalığının kök sebebini çözebiliyor. Oğlumuz Doğu’nun bu gen tedavisini almasını sağlamaya çalışıyoruz. Damar içine sadece bir defalık enjeksiyon ile Doğu’ya eksik olan SMN geni motor nöron hücrelerine iletiliyor ve geriye sadece onun kaslarını fizik tedavi yüzme vs ile güçlendirmemiz kalıyor. Ancak bu tedavinin uygulanma fiyatı tüm masraflar ile birlikte 2,4 Milyon Dolar… Bu ilacı alamadığı her gün motor nöronları zarar görüyor ve ölüyor… Doğu şu anda 1 yaşında ve zamanımız her geçen gün daralıyor çünkü bu ilaç yalnızca 2 yaşına kadar alınabiliyor. ilacı ne kadar erken alabilirsek iyileşme şansımız o kadar yüksek. Doğu için global bir bağış sitesi olan Gofundme üzerinden bir yardım kampanyası başlattık. Doğu’nun tek çaresi olan bu ilaca ulaşması ve yaşaması için sizlerin desteğine ihtiyacımız var.

A full genetic screening revealed that not only Kinley, but her younger sister Kennedy both have an extremely rare genetic disorder called GM1 Gangliosidosis.\\xa0 We are forever thankful that baby Kieran is not affected by this wretched disease.\\xa0Currently, there is no approved treatment or cure for GM1, and it is always fatal in children.********OUR NEW REALITYGM1 Gangliosidosis is an aggressive disease where the body does not produce adequate enzymes to break down certain molecules. Instead, these molecules collect on the brain and spinal cord, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. The list of complications that our girls face is truly terrifying and the idea of watching them slowly fade away is our worst nightmare.\\xa0Right now, Kinley and Kennedy are in a relatively “stable” state in their disease progression.\\xa0 They can still walk independently and are verbal, though both are experiencing speech issues that make them hard to understand.\\xa0 Looking at them, one would never know they both face such a grave fate, but there will come a day where each of them will no longer be able to run outside with their friends, jump on their trampoline, or tell their baby sister “I love you” if no treatments are developed.\\xa0 \\xa0Kinley, who wants nothing more than to be a doctor, nurse, or vet so she can help other people, will eventually not be able to take care of herself independently. \\xa0Kennedy, who loves to dance and sing and dress up, will someday not be able to do her infamous twirls and leaps, or “freeze” you with her Elsa powers.Each morning, we wake to the reality that we are another day closer to that outcome.\\xa0 One day, they won’t recognize their mom and dad.\\xa0 One day, they won’t be able to tell us they need something, or that they love us.\\xa0 One day, they will require a feeding tube.\\xa0 One day,\\xa0 we will lay two of our precious babies to rest.Life expectancy for the type of GM1 Kinley and Kennedy have is difficult to predict, but estimates range anywhere from mid-childhood (10-15 years old) to the early twenties. \\xa0We are hopeful that both Kinley and Kennedy have many more great years ahead of them at a quality of life that they both deserve. \\xa0 There is no way to know at what point the disease will firm its grip on Kinley and Kennedy - we are in a race against time.SOME HOPE - IT\\'S NOT TOO LATEThere are several treatment clinical trials coming up for both substrate suppression therapy and gene therapy through drug companies, universities, and the NIH.\\xa0 This Page is a mission of hope for our family and others impacted by GM1 Gangliosidosis, and provides support to ensure these trials and developments continue. We are committed to raising awareness of this horrid disease, and promoting funding for continued research and the advancement of current clinical trials that may eventually be accessible to these children, including our own.\\xa0 In fact, some believe a cure is imminent - it simply needs the support and dollars to advance. \\xa0We are not naive to the fact, however, that clinical trial spots are very, very limited\\xa0and are experimental, so there are never guarantees...but we do know that our girls do not need to suffer!We intend to soak in every moment with Kinley and Kennedy while they can still run, dance, sing, and just be kids.\\xa0 We now know how precious each and every day is, and appreciate every time we hear the words “I love you” from them, or hear them sing lullabies to their baby sister.\\xa0 While continuing to give our girls all the love we can, and show them the world as best we can, we simply must fight to find off-label treatments to slow the progression long enough for a cure to be developed.We will still show them the world, provide experiences even seasoned adults have never had, and make sure every moment they have on this earth is not taken for granted.\\xa0OUR GOALDeveloping treatments in the United States is notoriously expensive.\\xa0 For gene therapy specifically, it is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for a single clinical trial participant*. \\xa0We are raising $2,000,000 - the conservative estimate for both Kinley and Kennedy to participate in a gene therapy trial.\\xa0 We refuse to sit idly while our babies bodies slowly betray them and we can only achieve this goal with your support.\\xa0 Every dollar is immensely important, and sharing the information with your network can and will work miracles.\\xa0 Reaching this goal won’t guarantee Kinley and Kennedy treatment, but it will go far in advancing the development of the cures we and families in our position so desperately desire.We all say “we will do anything for our children”.\\xa0 We’re asking for you to help us in this journey so our children and other families in our position can retain hope that there is a better future for our babies.SPECIFIC WAYS TO HELP1) \\xa0If you’re in a position to do so, please consider a donation.\\xa0 Every dollar counts.2) \\xa0Spread the word - share to your social networks, email the GoFundMe information to anyone you know, and be sure to ask if your company has a donation matching program! \\xa0www.curekinleyandkennedy.org\\xa03) \\xa0AmazonSmiles - if you aren’t already supporting a charity of choice, please take a moment to update your AmazonSmiles beneficiary to Cure GM1 Foundation.\\xa0 After that, shop as you normally do, and a donation will automatically be provided for each dollar spent. \\xa0https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202029360\\xa04) \\xa0Forward any leads you may have to support our cause to our Facebook Page or our email address:\\xa0\\xa0https://www.facebook.com/CureKinleyKennedy\\xa0[email redacted]\\xa0WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?Every dollar will benefit the Cure GM1 Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance the development of life-saving treatments for GM1. \\xa0The Cure GM1 Foundation is currently funding a next generation\\xa0gene therapy program in collaboration\\xa0with a world class research team.\\xa0 The team is headed by Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz at Ohio State\\xa0University who works in close collaboration with Children\\'s Nationwide Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \\xa0Other initiatives\\xa0include funding research studies to further drug development, newborn screening,\\xa0and increasing overall awareness.All donations are 100% tax deductible!\\xa0*“Novel Financing Approaches Are Needed to Capitalize on Life-Saving Gene Therapies∗.” The American Consumer, The American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research, www.theamericanconsumer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gene-Therapy-FINAL.pdf.

Please offer whatever assistance you can as we wish for speedy health, recovery, and justice for Justin.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\"His name is Justin Howell. And he is my little brother.As this column\\xa0has argued\\xa0before, if you really want to know what happened, there is no substitute for the\\xa0raw, unedited video. In it, you will see five people carrying Justin’s limp body toward police headquarters, begging the officers to get him medical attention. As they do, the police fire some 15 rounds (many of which were at the protesters carrying my brother) over the course of about 30 seconds.“What the f---?” one of them yells.Exactly.Because the five people carrying Justin weren’t “begging” to get him medical attention — at least not in the typical sense. According to Chief of Police Brian Manley in a\\xa0recent press briefing, the protesters “were given direction to bring [Justin] to the officers” after which the demonstrators “were fired upon with less-lethal munitions as they brought [Justin] towards the officers to get him medical help.”Think about that. It’s unclear whether the officers who shot at the protesters were the same ones who gave them the order to approach. But at minimum, it takes a special kind of incompetence to fire at those who are doing as the police tell them. At minimum, it shows a complete inability to be aware of your surroundings and to manage the situation appropriately.There is no better evidence that here in Austin, Texas, the police are entirely out of their depth.I confirmed Manley’s account with a man named David Frost over Twitter. He was the one who filmed the aforementioned video, and he was able to provide me with another picture of my brother shortly after being hit. In the photo, his body is splayed upon the ground. Onlookers are rushing to his side.In our brief interview, Frost told me that “other protesters were throwing rocks, water bottles, and a backpack. [Justin] was not. The chief of police even said on Facebook live today. They shot the WRONG person.”\\xa0Indeed, Manley did admit as much during his briefing. But it’s worth considering that this is the world in which we live: If the police tell you something, it’s best to get a second source to confirm its accuracy.It’s also notable in his briefing how little effort Manley puts into taking responsibility for what happened. No, reader, I haven’t omitted the part of Manley’s statement where he seems contrite. There was no apology. Instead, he sat at his desk for three full minutes, gave us the details above and at no point apologized to my brother, my family or the five brave protesters who carried Justin to police headquarters under fire. (To those protesters: My family sees you, and we thank you.)And what is somehow worse, Manley concludes his remarks by saying: “We are praying for this young man and his family and we are hoping that his condition improves quickly. ”To which my family, a deeply religious one, says this: We aren’t interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.And responsible you are. Because Justin won’t be improving quickly. “It will be a marathon, not a sprint,” according to one of his doctors.He has a fractured skull. He has brain damage. Doctors anticipate that when he wakes up, he will have difficulty telling his left from his right.These “less-lethal” munitions are only “less-lethal” by technicality. My brother’s condition shows what can happen when you fire them into a crowd.Earlier this week, the Austin-American Statesman reported that the Austin City Council “will hold an emergency hearing [on Thursday] to address concerns about officer’s response to racial justice protests over the weekend and to address what they see as little cooperation from Austin police leadership to transform policies.”We shall see if anything comes of it. Expect suggestions in a later column.\"\\n\\n- Joshua Howell via http://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-his-name-is-justin-howell/article_93a79c44-a5b6-11ea-aa54-ebc0da33cc35.html\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFurther account of the incident\\n\\n*Graphic detail from the medical lead holding his head and being shot at*\\n\\n https://www.facebook.com/indiskies/posts/10158789553861614?hc_location=ufi\\n\\n#JustinHowell\\n\\n#Justice4Justin\\n\\n#Justice4JustinHowell\\n\\n#HisNameIsJustinHowell\\n\\nDEMAND THAT APD OFFICERS AND OFFICERS EVERYWHERE CHARGED/FIRED FOR INSTANCES OF EXCESSIVE FORCE HAVE THEIR PENSIONS AND ASSETS SEIZED SO AS TO SAVE TAXPAYER WASTE STEMMING FROM RECKLESS AND RUTHLESS COPS\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\"'\n",

On July 8th Adeline went into work for her 12 hour shift in the ER. While she mostly works delivering babies, she was doing a rotation in the ER, treating COVID patients. That morning she went into work feeling well and excited to see patients, but by the evening she began to feel under the weather. What started as intense flu-like symptoms escalated within the week to a hospital stay. Adeline spent the next few weeks battling COVID and was treated with several different respiratory therapies and put on dozens of drugs. When there was no positive response to these methods of treatment Adeline decided to begin an experimental drug trial. However, before we could see if this new drug was effective, her lungs could no longer support her. On August 3rd Adeline was intubated and placed on a ventilator. That night her vitals were unstable and the doctors said that she was not responding well to the ventilator. After consulting with our parents, the doctors took the last remaining step available. At 1am on August 4th Adeline was placed on ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The catheters used in the ECMO machine involved an invasive procedure to place them in her femoral artery. The ventilator opens her lungs through positive pressure, while the ECMO machine oxygenates her blood. This leaves Adeline’s lungs with the only task of healing themselves. It is projected that Adeline will be on the ventilator and ECMO for at least 6-8 weeks. Since we are from Syracuse, NY, our parents have had to travel back and forth to be there for Adeline and continue to support our family. While our Dad’s job can be done virtually, our Mom’s cannot and therefore she cannot work. In addition, our Mom helps to take care of our 91 year old grandmother, the responsibility of which has now fallen on us. When Adeline gets off life support, she will need physical, respiratory, and occupational therapy to regain her strength and mobility. At this time, we do not know how long a full recovery will take or when she will be able to return to work.Donations made to Adeline’s cause will go toward medical expenses, her bills, travel expenses, and to support the family while we navigate this difficult time.We want everyone to know that Adeline is a fighter. She is determined and has set her mind to surviving this virus. As she fights everyday for her life, we need to stay strong for her on the home front.

If not---the short story is that my husband (Jeff) and son (Judge) came within an inch of their lives when they were crushed by a 75 foot red oak tree that fell during a storm in Nashville. Three year old Judge suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and was in a coma for two weeks, all the while being closely and carefully monitored by the heroes at Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children\\'s Hospital at Vanderbilt. Because neither our hometown of Nashville, nor the State of Tennessee offers inpatient rehabilitation for children with brain injuries, Vanderbilt transferred Judge to Children\\'s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), where we have been since May 27th. Jeff shattered 19 ribs, both of his scapulas, punctured a lung, and grotesquely broke his back (sorry, but that\\'s how it was described to us), requiring spinal surgery to both fuse his broken vertebrae and to insert a steel rod. It\\'s nothing short of a miracle that both survived their injuries, and in Jeff\\'s case, is able to use his legs. Because of the global pandemic, cruelly, neither Jeff nor Judge have been allowed visitors during their hospital stays. I\\'ve been living with Judge and, mercifully, both hospitals have made a couple of exceptions along the way, so that Jeff could see Judge and I for a short time...but our family having to be apart over the last six weeks with no other visitors has been very tough for us to endure emotionally. Thankfully, Jeff has since moved on to outpatient status and is doing his rehabilitation work at the renowned Shepherd Center in Atlanta, while staying in an apartment nearby the facility. We\\'re incredibly grateful that both Jeff and Judge were able to transfer to two of the top facilities in the country to undergo their rehab work. Once Judge is discharged from CHOA and is ready to begin his outpatient work, we have rented a home where the three of us will finally reunite as a family. What a happy day that will be! Jeff & Judge\\'s doctors have been straight-forward in stressing the long-term therapy and care both will require. We don\\'t know yet how Judge\\'s young brain will heal but doctors have warned us that he may have life-long complications from the severity of his injuries. But we pray for a complete healing everyday, and we are certain that our family (extended to include you) is still living through an active, fluid, and dynamic miracle, that our precious Judge will recover fully, and will live a full and rich life, forever to be known as the boy that took on a majestic red oak, and lived to tell about it!\\xa0In the few moments Jeff and I have been afforded alone, we\\'ve begun to get an understanding of the fallout from this tragedy, both in terms of financial expenses and disruption to our professional lives. We\\'re absorbing the sobering reality that the cost of this unexpected event outstretches the resources we have available. This has been a humbling exercise, and one that has required us to face our hubris, and drop our pride for the good of our family, especially for Judge. We\\'re heeding the advice given by our brother Thad \\xa0Cockrell from one of his most inspired songs; \"Pride won\\'t get us where we\\'re going\". Where we\\'re going is home, in every sense of that word...and we need your help in getting there.

It\\'s overwhelming to consider the encouragement, love and support we\\'ve already received, and we\\'re awestruck by the grace and generosity provided us daily, both in ways we see, and in ways unseen but felt. \\xa0\\xa0Please know that once we\\'re to the other side of this, a \"Healthy Family Together Again\", and back on firm footing, both physically and financially, we\\'ll repay the charity given us to the life-saving, care-giving, soul-enriching healthcare providers who have nurtured Judge back to good heath, sound mind and strong spirit. We\\'ll forever think of you as we support Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children\\'s Hospital at Vanderbilt, as well as CHOA.

      " '----- Generating with seed: \"Last October, Jeff Atlas was diagnosed with stage three, high risk multiple myeloma, which is an incurable bone marrow cancer that attacks your blood plasma and that has resulted, for him, in full renal failure. 85% of patients with multiple myeloma are considered low risk, unfortunately Jeff is among the roughly 15% who are considered high risk due to chromosomal characteristics. This means that Jeff\\'s particular cancer is more difficult to treat and keep under control, as it frequently finds a way to outsmart and become resistant to the treatments. For our friend Jeff, the last 9 months have been a continuous battle, where each new treatment offers a limited reprieve before his cancerous cells multiply and regain strength.\\xa0Since last October, Jeff has endured a rigorous schedule of dialysis three times a week, chemotherapy treatments a minimum of three times per week, as well as multiple lengthy inpatient hospitalizations. It has been an unrelenting and exhausting battle.Jeff is a self employed clinical psychologist who has dedicated his professional career to helping others. It is now Jeff who is in need of our help. Due to the demand of his therapies, Jeff has been unable to work since last September. Jeff and his wife Leisa have three children, Katie (22) rising senior in college, Kyle (19) rising junior in college, and Jake (17) rising senior in high school. Jeff is the sole source of income for their family.\\xa0 Though their privacy must be respected, it’s worth noting that with three kids in school, they are selling their home in an effort to continue providing for Jeff’s health care, pay bills, and to support their childrens’ educational wellbeing. They remain in a precarious financial situation with no easy solution.I think it is clear to anyone who knows the Atlases that Jeff is kind, warm, and compassionate, and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do for his family and friends. Jeff and Leisa along with their children have been a staple of the Marvin community for as long as they’ve lived here, always welcoming and essential to so many of our lives. Jeff and Leisa would be making this Go Fund Me for any of us if we were in this situation, so I’m writing to ask that you donate any amount—however small or large—so that the emotional and physical stress of Jeff’s illness won’t be further compounded by financial concerns.**Jeff and Leisa welcome spiritual support in whatever form that may be. Jeff is currently undergoing rigorous preparations for a tandem stem cell transplant in the beginning of August, which if successful, could offer him more precious time with his family and friends. Jeff and Leisa greatly appreciate any well wishes you are able to offer.\"'\n",

      " '----- Generating with seed: \"Scooter’s Recovery- First of all, you need to know that Scooter wouldn’t want me to do this. It’s going to make him feel so uncomfortable, but with all sincerity, I know he would do it for me.My best friend and roommate in college Scott Ward, affectionately called “Scooter” (a childhood nickname, not because he uses a wheelchair) by most who know him, is a sports psychologist by trade. More importantly, he is a son, a brother, a husband, a counselor to college students, a coworker, a friend. Scooter is also a SURVIVOR!In 1986 as a freshman in college, he survived a freak diving accident on an obstacle course that caused a high (C4/5) but incomplete injury to his spinal cord. Doctors at first gave him little chance for survival, then gave him little chance for independent breathing or voluntary movement below his shoulders, then gave him little chance for living a full, active life.With the expertise of therapists, the support of family and friends, but mostly with his own initiative and resourcefulness, he effectively relearned so much of life—how to move, to eat, to write, to transfer from his wheelchair to his car and back again, to drive, to focus, to work. He graduated from college, then went on to earn a master’s degree and doctoral degree. I first met Scooter while I was an undergraduate on the track team and he was finishing up his doctorate in Sports Psychology. It did not take long for Scooter to make me feel like we had known each other for years (anybody who has met him knows exactly what I’m talking about). I made it a point to stop by his office anytime I could because he would project so much positive energy it was impossible not to feel better with just a short visit.During one of my stops by his office, I asked him how his dissertation was coming along. Scooter replied in a nonchalant tone, “I wasn’t very productive last night since I flipped over backwards in my chair and couldn’t get up.” Wait…what? Having a new friend in a wheelchair comes with all sorts of questions, but this was shocking to hear. Me: So, what did you do?!?Scoot: Well, my roommate wasn’t at home and it was too late to call anybody, so I just slept on the floor until my roommate got home.This just blew my mind. It made me immediately realize just how tough and bold this guy is. Life literally flipped him over and he just got back up and kept going!I (along with many others) could tell stories all day about how much of an amazing person Scooter is. It is only appropriate that he found an equally amazing wife in Robin. They married in 2005 and have been a perfect fit ever since.Fast forward to October 2016. I will never forget the panic in Robin’s voice when she called me while driving to the hospital in Kansas City. Scooter had passed out in the shower and was unresponsive. He was being life flighted to KUMED after what was ultimately deemed an aortic dissection (a spontaneous tear in the largest blood vessel of the body). This required emergency open heart surgery and doctors had his odds of survival at less than 30%. He survived! However, just five weeks into recovery and in his final stages of rehab he suffered ANOTHER heart attack. This required another risky open heart surgery with even much lower odds of survival. Still, he survived. All of this leaves him with a heart functioning at less than 15%. Scooter never backed down and put everything he had into rehab and gaining his strength back. He went back to work much earlier than anybody had predicted. As a sports psychologist, he counsels student-athletes in all sports to sharpen their mental toughness and overcome barriers of all types. He doesn’t just “talk the talk” he “walks the walk”. This guy was born with a love and knack for helping people find their way. He counsels people to break through the doubt that gets in the way of success. He does this everyday by getting up at 5am to start the tedious tasks of showering and getting dressed to make it to the office or teach a class by 8am. He does this with a heart that is functioning at less than 15% and a major loss of muscle mass and strength. He does this with a smile on his face and still projects enough positive energy to make athletes believe they can run through brick walls. He was born for this!Unfortunately, Scooter was also born with genetic polycystic kidney disease. In 2018 the onset of the disease was sped up by the heart medication and numerous rounds of high-powered antibiotics he had been taking. This situation developed a grapefruit-sized tumor on his kidneys that was initially misdiagnosed as a pancreatic cancer. Days of waiting for testing without nutrition led to even more muscle loss and acute skin break down. Ultimately, his kidneys began to fail and doctors have added two to three dialysis treatments a week that take another 4 hours per treatment out of his day.A few weeks later, he was rushed back to the hospital to correct an extremely high level of carbon dioxide in his blood that had built up over months, likely from low heart function and decreased mobility. He survived that life-threatening episode, too, and now has to use BPAP and oxygen therapy every night.Scooter’s physicians have said that, to their knowledge, he is “an n of 1”—in other words, they know of no one else living an active, productive life with a high cervical spinal cord injury, heart disease and kidney disease. Doctors who meet Scooter for the first time are amazed by his optimism. “He looks better in real life than he does on paper,” and his life reflects that.I’m no doctor, but I could have told you over 20 years ago and I’m telling you now that Scooter is “an n of 1”. He is Superman. He literally changes people’s lives for the better every day with a body full of organs that have tried to quit on him. He is a selfless Superman.Scooter and his wife, Robin, know they are fortunate. They are surrounded by people who care and who have been with them every step of the way. They are grateful for every “bonus day” they have together. They both actively make a living, and they contribute to the community, independently and together. What they are facing now, though, despite paying for and having the best health insurance plan available to them, is a cascade of out-of-pocket health expenses that have drained their accounts and their energy. They pay the portions insurance does not pay for dialysis, BPAP and oxygen support, plus expensive dressings and supplies, and any nursing/physical help he receives at home. Since 2017 Scooter has also battled skin issues, something new to his life of 30+ years in a wheelchair. Deep ischial wounds have required two surgeries and the use of a specialty wound VAC machine. These skin issues are rough on the rump for a guy who spends all of his time in a chair. Believe it or not, these are as debilitating as anything he has dealt with. These issues require the help of Robin and others to transfer him from his bed to his chair every morning and night. He has done everything medically he can do locally and has decided to see specialists and surgeons at the Mayo Clinic to hopefully heal them for good. This final piece of the recovery puzzle could literally put him back in the driver seat and back to his strong and independent life he lived just four years ago.Next month, I will be driving him there because it’s a safer way for him to travel and because he likes my jokes. His compromised health puts him at higher risk of becoming ill if exposed to COVID-19, so surgery, follow-up care, and at least a six-week period of recovery in the Minneapolis area is in store. Scooter will be confined to a hospital bed, eight hours away from home, during a time when visitors are strictly limited. Although insurance is still very helpful, there are expenses that are not covered—tough at any time, but especially during the current economic climate. I am going to trust the expertise from the team at the Mayo Clinic to relieve the stress of his skin condition but I plan to reach out to as many as I can to help relieve the financial stress of this mission. Anything you are able to give is much appreciated. Please share his story and continue to spread the positive energy he has shared with so many.The world would be a better place if it had more people like Scooter. Seeing that he is “an n of 1” means we need to take care of the only one we have!\"'\n",

Even with all the press around the initiative, John asked not to be mentioned by name, making the focus about others struggling with this insidious disease.Then John partnered with Major League Baseball for their 2019 Winter Meetings\\xa0 to raise money for five other ALS charities through athlete and team experiences.

She speaks French, loves to travel, read, listen to music, write poetry and swim. She spent 8 weeks in France as an exchange student when she was a sophomore in high school and worked at a refugee camp in Greece for 2 weeks when she was a senior. She also worked on her school’s newspaper and wrote articles for one of her local Idaho newspapers. She was captain of the swim team junior year and spent summers working for her dad at Grumpy’s. After graduation and acceptance to Northeastern University’s international start program she left for Sydney Australia in July of 2019 for her first semester of college.\\xa0Sadly, things changed when Faye was back in Boston for her second semester. In February of 2020, Faye thinking she had the flu took an Uber to Boston Medical Center because she had been sick for several days and her fever was 104 degrees. Instead of the flu, she was diagnosed with mono. The doctors running tests were concerned about her blood counts so admitted her for further testing. Her mom came to Boston and upon arrival they were told she has leukemia. After a bone marrow biopsy, she was specifically diagnosed with high-risk B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.\\xa0Faye began treatment in Boston and was transferred to Seattle Children’s Hospital at the end of March. After 3 months of intense chemotherapy Faye was given the news she would need a bone marrow transplant. She had a small population of leukemia cells that were resistant to the chemo she had been given. This was her best chance for long term survival. In addition, she was told that she would be infertile due to the full body irradiation and high dose chemo she would receive prior to transplant. WOW…what a change in this young ladies life.\\xa0Faye is strong and a fighter so she decided bone marrow transplant it is! In addition, she chose to have an ovary removed for a chance of fertility preservation. This is new science and Faye was the first person to have it done at Seattle Children’s. Her ovary was transferred overnight to Pittsburgh where it was processed and frozen and will end up in Minnesota for long term storage.\\xa0In the meantime, a house has been rented for a year in Seattle close to the hospital. Pete is driving back and forth to Idaho to run both business during a pandemic. Restaurants and bars aren’t the best line of work to be in right now but if you know Pete he is making it happen! Molly has stopped working to be Faye’s caregiver and neither she nor Faye have been home since Faye’s diagnosis. George is beginning his senior year of college and hoping he will not get sent home to work online again!\\xa0\\xa0Because Faye’s immune system will be like that of a newborn baby she was told not to work or attend school in person for a year. Faye loves to learn so her goal is to begin classes online in the spring and eventually attend the University of Washington full time. Even though she took a medical leave of absence and eventually withdrew from Northeastern she has not stopped learning. She watches you tube videos that college professors have posted of classes that interest her. She watches tv shows in Norwegian to help her learn another “easy” language. Her French teacher from high school has sent her books in French and gave her a list of others to read. She is an amazing young lady!\\xa0The funds raised are to help with medical costs not covered by insurance and costs associated with the transplant process…rental apartment in Boston, bills from Boston Medical Center and Boston Children’s, rental house in Seattle, lost tuition at Northeastern, fertility preservation surgery (not covered by insurance), long term health care.\\xa0There is a caring bridge set up to follow her progress if you wish to./https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/fayeprekeges\\xa0In lieu of funds, especially with a pandemic hitting us all hard in our economy, we ask that you register as a bone marrow donor, so in the future you to may be able to save a life. bethematch.org\"'\n",

En el mes de mayo que tenía su quinta dosis de gammaglobulina, se observó que la cuenta de linfocitos bajaron mucho, sin embargo, se sentía perfectamente bien, después de dos semanas comenzó con una fiebre muy rara de cada 24 horas, fue ingresado al hospital por ser un paciente\\xa0 de alto riesgo de covid19, al ingresar en el hospital le realizaron una series de estudios y exámenes donde incluyen rayos X, exámenes de sangre, entre otros y en una tomografía computarizada, sale la presencia de\\xa0 varios nódulos, cosa que alertó a los médico y éstos decidieron hacerle una punción en el pulmón. El diagnóstico que dieron en México fue de un linfoma no Hodgkin de células B grandes difusas con presencia del virus de Epstein-Barr, sin embargo, los padres decidieron tener una segunda opinión que confirmaran este diagnóstico y es cuando les aconsejaron ir a Houston ya que ésta es la ciudad con más expertos en oncología, inicialmente contaban con un seguro de gastos médicos sin embargo este no dio cobertura. Después de realizar numerosos estudios se pudo llegar a un diagnóstico definitivo y es el de Granulomatosis Linfomatoide.La Granulomatosis Linfomatoide es una enfermedad poco frecuente, que entra en las llamadas ¨enfermedades raras¨ relacionada con los linfomas que se define como un proceso linfoproliferativo de células B, angiodestructivo, que se asocia con infección por el virus de Epstein-Barr. El órgano afectado con más frecuencia es el pulmón donde pueden observarse múltiples nódulos provocando insuficiencia respiratoria y disnea. al ser un proceso multi orgánico puede presentarse en órganos tales como: piel, sistema nervioso, tracto gastrointestinal, hígado, bazo, riñón y corazón. La afectación cerebral puede provocar entre otros síntomas convulsiones y suele existir aumento del tamaño del bazo. El proceso tiende a evolucionar a un linfoma maligno, si no se trata a tiempo. Es por esto que debemos actuar cuanto antes.Esta enfermedad poco común se ha visto presentada en personas de edad avanzada por lo que lo hace más rara que se presente en edad joven como la de Moisés. El equipo oncológico del Texas Children´s Hospital, sugiere y recomienda que Moisés sea referido a Maryland donde se encuentra un equipo médico con experiencia en este diagnóstico. Ciclos de quimioterapias y otras drogas son parte del tratamiento, y se tiene un tiempo estimado de 9 a 12 meses de tratamientoTodo este proceso ha sido muy costoso y lo seguirá siendo, actualmente su familia no cuenta con el dinero para llevarlo a cabo,\\xa0 es por esto que sus amigos hemos decidido abrir esta campaña para recaudar los fondos necesarios lo antes posible y así poder sufragar los gastos que esta situación implica.¡Espero que Moi y su familia puedan contar con tu ayuda!\\xa0\\n-----------\\xa0Moisés Yahir Benitah Luna (known to all as Moy) is a young Venezuelan who went to live in Mexico 6 years ago with his family, Moises is the eldest son of Youlyn and Elias Benitah, he has 2 sisters, a 13 year old and one of 9 years old, currently Moses is 18 years old.Moses was diagnosed last December with severe combined primary immunodeficiency TB-NK +, Moses must receive gamma globulin every 28 days. In the month of May when he had his fifth dose of gamma globulin, it was observed that the lymphocyte count dropped a lot, however, he felt perfectly well, after two weeks he started with a very rare fever every 24 hours, he was admitted to the hospital for being a high-risk patient for covid19. Upon entering, the hospital carried out a series of studies and exams including x-rays, blood tests, among others, then,\\xa0 in a CT scan, they found the presence of several nodules, which alerted the doctors making them\\xa0 decide to puncture the lung, showing a diagnose of diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus.However, Moi’s parents decided to look for a second opinion that can confirm the diagnosis, thats when they decided to travel to Houston to visit a group of oncologist.\\xa0 Initially, they were counting with their health insurance to take over this expenses, unfortunately this wasn\\'t the case. \\xa0The coverage for the studies wasn\\'t included on the original policy.\\xa0 They decided to continue forward. At the hospital, they performed multiple exams to get to the final diagnose of a “Lynphomatoid Granulomatosis”.The Lynphomatoid Granulomatosis is a rare disorder, characterized by an overproduction of white blood cells known as B lymphocytes. These B cells can build up in the tissues of the body, causing damage to the blood vessels. In many cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the abnormal B cells contain the Epstein-Barr mostly occur to males.\\xa0 The organ that is mostly affected by this condition are the lungs, you may see the presence of multiple nodules causing shortness of breath and cough.\\xa0 Other organs that can be affected are the skin, the nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidneys, and heart.\\xa0 If the brain is been affected can produce convulsions, and enlargement of the spleen.\\xa0 If this condition is not taken on time could develop into a malignant lymphoma. That is why we need to act fast.\\xa0This extremely rare disease is mostly seen on people of advanced age, what make´s it even more rare on Moi, an 18 year old young man.\\xa0 The oncology team at Texas Children’s Hospital recommended transfering Moi to a program in Maryland, where there is a group of physicians with experience in this area. Some of the recommended treatments are several rounds of chemotherapy combined with others oral and IV drugs. This will take between 9-12 month.All this process, besides the physical load, takes also financial pressure on Moi’s family, they don’t count with the money to offer his son the treatment that he needs.\\xa0 This is why, we, their friends, decided to open this page to help them raise the founds they need.

The untimely passing of Ryan has left his family and friends shocked and heartbroken.\\nMany of us know Ryan through his many Accomplishments in the Hockey industry.  Ryan began working at Tri-Town Ice Arena in 2004 and was the head coach of Junior Hockey and the General Manager of the New Hampshire Junior Monarchs Organization. He was regarded in the hockey community as a leader, an innovator, an advocate, and a trailblazer.

It is evident who has been influenced by Ryan-each person to cross his path worked harder, laughed louder, and valued each moment a little more.\\nRyan was a dedicated husband and a loving father. His proudest accomplishment in life was his family.  The love between Ryan and Anastasia started 20 years ago when they met at SNHU.

For those of you who don’t personally know her, well she is probably one of the strongest, most positive, energetic, happy souls out there, and we know you would love her like we do. Ashlee is quite a private person, but finally has given us permission to share her current family struggle as we know that people will want to help her during this difficult time.Last week, Ashlee’s 19 year old son Michael was diagnosed with a form of T Cell Lymphoma called Hepatosplenic Lymphoma. He immediately started chemotherapy treatment at Miami Children’s hospital and they are staying positive and strong. They already know that he is in need of a Bone Marrow Transplant. This could take place as early as late September, but right now it’s a waiting game. He first needs to undergo aggressive treatment to prepare his body for that procedure. The BMT itself is a very intense long process but has great success rates and is what Michael needs.For those of you who don’t know, Ashlee is a single mom of 3, as her husband passed away from a similar form of cancer a little over 4 years ago. She is also self employed, so basically if she doesn’t teach/work, she has no income coming in, and as you can imagine her business was already affected due to Covid-19.We want to raise these funds for her so that she doesn’t concern herself with having to make a choice whether to go teach a class or stay by her son’s side during the tough days ahead. We already know that for a minimum of 5 weeks during the BMT she will not be able to work at all as she will be his caregiver during the process. At this stage she also has no idea what his insurance will cover, but it’s pretty clear there will also be additional medical bills. If we raise these funds for her, she will not have to worry about making money to put food on the table, pay rent, and tackle those bills that will start piling up.We are aware that many people are currently going through financial issues so completely\\xa0 understand if you cannot donate, but even just keeping this special family in your thoughts and prayers will be very much appreciated.I ask that you please give the Cramer Family their privacy during this difficult time, but feel free to reach out to me (Vicky) if you have any questions.Thank you all and we will update you soon on Michael\\'s progress.Organizers: Vicky Politi, Nicola Brisuela, Marie Gaschler, Kristin Douthit Richards.\"'\n",
      " '----- Generating with seed: \"If you’re reading this, you likely know that Mike Barnett is one of the premier fiddle players of his generation. From his work touring with bluegrass legend Ricky Skaggs, to his Grammy-nominated solo endeavors, Mike has wowed audiences for years with his virtuosic and creative approach to the fiddle. Now, he needs our help.On Saturday, July 25th, Mike suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while at home in Nashville. Mike’s wife Annalise was with him at the time, and quickly got him to the TriStar Skyline hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery to remove the massive clot in his brain. The surgeons determined that he bled from an “arteriovenous malformation,” which he was likely born with. After several days in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit at Skyline, Annalise and his family decided to transfer him to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he underwent a second surgery to repair the AVM and reduce brain swelling, on Aug 1st. Much to the relief of his family and friends, the surgeons reported the surgery a great success. He spent another week or so in the ICU, and was released to a general hospital bed on Aug 8th, where he has since been gaining strength and making amazing strides towards regaining consciousness and motor functions on his left side. Thus ends “the thriller,” as Annalise has dubbed it, and so begins “the marathon.”Mike is going to need extensive therapy going forward. Although he shows many remarkable signs of progress, he remains unable to fully express himself in speech or written language, and has very limited mobility on the left side of his body. Everyone in Mike’s life wants him to get the best therapy possible, to maximize the likelihood that Mike could regain some quality of life, and possibly even play fiddle again. His family has painstakingly considered many options, in order to choose the rehab center most suited to his needs.Annalise and Mike’s parents have determined that his best bet is the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. Shepherd is consistently ranked one of the best in the country, and luckily enough, they have a room opening up this week. As an inpatient, Mike will receive 3-5 hours of rehab every day, which will include speech, physical, and occupational therapy. His stay will be at least 6 weeks, possibly longer. Annalise will be able to stay there with him, a huge benefit of Shepherd (many other rehab facilities aren’t even allowing visitors due to Covid), and she’ll receive emotional support in the form of therapy groups for spouses/family.As I’m sure you can imagine, Shepherd isn’t cheap. The cost of his stay will exceed both what is covered by insurance and the financial resources available to him. It is with the utmost humility and gratitude that his loved ones ask for your help. These funds will allow for Mike to get the absolute best care at this crucial time, and will go a long way to alleviate the financial burdens Annalise will face in adjusting to a new city and a new reality. With your help, it is possible to imagine a bright future for Mike and Annalise; one of good health and free of substantial medical debt.His friends and family are exceptionally grateful for the outpouring of love and support Mike has received thus far. If you can, please consider a donation to aid in the recovery of everyone’s favorite guy and truly brilliant musician, Mike Barnett.\"'\n",

Mike is a much loved, lifelong resident of Norfolk, VA. He has been a close friend to many of you reading this and has been a dear friend to the many of us who have organized and disseminated this GoFundMe campaign. Five years ago, Mike was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease. Many of you are familiar with this horrible affliction, or even know another person who has ALS or has passed away from this disease - one that currently has no cure. ALS causes the death of the neurons that control voluntary muscle movement throughout the body. At some point, short of a miracle, it is fatal to all who contract it. (please go to https://www.als.org/understanding-als/what-is-als for more information). Our collective goal with this campaign is to keep Mike, Amy, Stanton & Archer (and their dog Ranger) in what has truly become their family home - for the long term.If you know Mike and his circumstances, then you have likely observed his life dramatically change in the last few years - particularly in the last 12 months. Mike has reached the point where many everyday functions are no longer possible - such things as eating, getting dressed, climbing the stairs, going to the bathroom, taking a shower, answering the phone, walking outside, and getting into the car. Thanks to his employer, Mike has been able to continue working remotely and should be able to do so for the immediate future.\\xa0While other options were seriously contemplated, Mike and Amy have decided that it’s best for their family to remain in their home - and the time has come where they need help in turning their home into one that is suitable for someone with his limited mobility. It is the intention of this GoFundMe Campaign to raise at least $150,000 to make some of the necessary additions & renovations to the Cutter home in order to accommodate Mike\\'s disabilities. This will include, but not limited to, modification to home entrances, renovation of a downstairs room into a master bedroom, the addition of a downstairs bathroom with disability fixtures, a motorized wheelchair, a motor vehicle with disability accommodation, and any other ADA modifications.\\xa0 A born giver, Mike is very hesitant to ask for much in the way of help - so we are doing this for him and his family because we all love him! Please join us and donate financially to help the Cutters meet the challenges that lie ahead. If you are a contractor or business owner who wishes to donate materials, services or labor to the Campaign, please contact me, Archie Wright (757-374-3594) or Jeff Parker (757-478-9920).\\xa0In Mike\\'s WordsIn 2015, after months of testing on my right hand, I was shockingly diagnosed with ALS. For a while I lived without great complication due to the slow progression of my form of ALS; I have only in the last year or so felt its increasing debilitating effects. My arms are very weak - I’m no longer able to drive and I usually need help eating and getting dressed - and I am now having trouble with walking. I miss helping others, playing ball with my boys, and walking our dog.\\xa0 Other than mental anguish I am in no physical pain (unless I fall and bust my head open or break a collar bone - yep that’s happened). I am confounded with my current position, more easily angered and often frustrated; but despite my physical and mental battle each and every day with this beast, I’m still in good spirits and try to laugh at myself while remaining positive, faithful and hopeful. I’m most proud of my family; my 24-year marriage to my wife Amy, and being blessed with our sons Stanton (2005) and Archer (2009). We very much appreciate your willingness to help make possible this transition in our lives and in our home.With much love, thanks and humility,MikePlease take the time to think and pray about this opportunity to offer financial support to this campaign - no matter the amount. We all thank you for doing what you can to help Mike, Amy, Stanton, and Archer.Thank you,The Organizers\"'\n",
